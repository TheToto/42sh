.SH SHELL GRAMMAR
.SS Simple commands
A simple command is a sequence of variable assigments, commands and their arguments separeted by a white space. Every simple command has an exit status which is its return value.

.SS Pipelines
A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the operator '|'. The specificity of a pipeline lays in the usage of the standard output of the the command at the left of '|' as the standard input of the command at the right of the operator.
Moreover, commands are executed simulteanously.

.SS Lists
A list is a sequence of one or mroe pipelines separated by the operators:
.TP
.BR ;
This operator specifies that commands will be executed one by one from the left to the right independantly of their exit status.
.TP
.BR &
This operator currently works as a semicolon (;)
.TP
.BR &&
This operator is the logical operator AND. If the exit status of the command at the left of the operator is 0, then the command at the right of the operator is executed and the exit status will be the one of the right command. Otherwise, the right command is not executed and the exit status is the one of the left command.
.TP
.BR ||
This operator is the logical operator OR. If the exit status of the command at the left of the operator is not 0, then the command at the right of the operator is executed and the exit status will be the one of the right command.
